# hyperstructures

This project implements the basic framework of category theory  in Scala/Spark. IMPORTANT: this library is different from projects such as Scalaz andf Cats, in that Hyperstructures aims at implementing the full blown categorical machinery, not methods and tools of CT for functional programming. Categories and functors will be represented by type classes in scala.
